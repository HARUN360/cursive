<p>My name is Harun Or Roshid, and I am a junior web developer. I live in Dhaka, Bangladesh. I studied Computer Science at Sherpur Polytechnic. This year, my diploma will be completed, and I am currently in my last semester. I love working in web development, which is why I started analyzing this field during my 4th semester. I have also completed several courses in web development, including a complete web development course by Jhankar Mahbub on Programming Hero. Currently, I am doing an internship at Creative IT focused on web development. I enjoy problem-solving a lot, and I love learning new things. I hope that wherever I work, I will be able to contribute positively to the company with my skills.</p>
